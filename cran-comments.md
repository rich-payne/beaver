## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Utilized `\donttest` for the example with the comment:
*The {beaver} package, by definition, performs MCMC for multiple models. Even with a small number of chains/burn-ins/samples, a minimally illustrative example requires >5s to run.* On my local system,
the example runs in approximately 1 minute.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
